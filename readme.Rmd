First, the user selects the Region of interest on the left side panel.
    
    
There is a main tab and a data tab. 
    
   
In the main tab, the user can select to display 
the US choropleth map by Population, by Income or by number of High School Graduates, 
which refreshes itself accordingly. 
   
   
When the user hovers over the state, a pop up showing the state name and the parameter of interest is displayed.
   
   
In the data tab, the user is able to look at the actual data and download a copy of it.
